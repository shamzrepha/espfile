Kinematics and Kinetics in Mechanics
1. Kinematics
Kinematics is the branch of mechanics that deals with the motion of objects without considering the forces that cause the motion. It focuses on parameters such as:

Displacement (s) – The change in position of an object.
Velocity (v) – The rate of change of displacement with time.
Acceleration (a) – The rate of change of velocity with time.
Types of Motion in Kinematics
Rectilinear Motion – Motion along a straight line.
