KINEMATICS AND KINETICS IN MECHANICS

1. KINEMATICS
Kinematics is the study of the motion of objects without considering the forces that cause the motion. It deals with:
- Displacement (s): Change in position.
- Velocity (v): Rate of change of displacement.
- Acceleration (a): Rate of change of velocity.

TYPES OF MOTION:
A. Rectilinear Motion (Straight-line motion):
   - Equations of Motion (for constant acceleration):
     v = u + at
     s = ut + (1/2)at^2
     v^2 = u^2 + 2as
   - Free Fall: Motion under gravity (g = 9.8 m/s^2).

B. Projectile Motion:
   - Horizontal velocity: v_x = u cos(θ) (constant)
   - Vertical velocity: v_y = u sin(θ) - gt
   - Time of flight: T = (2u sin(θ))/g
   - Maximum height: H = (u^2 sin^2(θ))/(2g)
   - Range: R = (u^2 sin(2θ))/g

C. Circular Motion:
   - Angular velocity: ω = dθ/dt
   - Centripetal acceleration: a_c = v^2/r = ω^2 r

2. KINETICS
Kinetics deals with the forces that cause motion. It is based on Newton’s Laws of Motion.

NEWTON'S LAWS OF MOTION:
1. First Law (Inertia): An object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force.
2. Second Law (Force & Acceleration): F = ma.
3. Third Law (Action & Reaction): Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

WORK, ENERGY, AND POWER:
- Work: W = Fd cos(θ)
- Kinetic Energy: KE = (1/2)mv^2
- Potential Energy: PE = mgh
- Power: P = W/t
- Conservation of Energy: Total energy remains constant.

MOMENTUM AND IMPULSE:
- Momentum: p = mv
- Impulse: J = FΔt
- Conservation of Momentum: m1u1 + m2u2 = m1v1 + m2v2

FRICTION:
- Static Friction: f_s ≤ μ_s N
- Kinetic Friction: f_k = μ_k N

DYNAMICS OF CIRCULAR MOTION:
- Centripetal Force: F_c = mv^2/r

CONCLUSION:
- Kinematics describes motion using equations without considering forces.
- Kinetics explains motion in terms of forces, energy, and momentum.
- Both are essential in solving physics and engineering problems.
